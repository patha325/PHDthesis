\section{Testbeam}
Generic set-up. Where was this done? Etc. etc.

\section{TASD-testbeam}
\subsection{Setup}
Different datasets, beam intensities etc. etc.
\subsection{Results}
What were the results, showed that the software seems to work, both digitisation and reconstruction. Anything else? All the electronics etc. To few planes. No magnetic field.

\section{MIND-testbeam}
\subsection{Setup}
Will we have different datasets with different detector layouts? 
\subsection{Results}

Confirm reconstruction even further. Will be able to properly run the code on the data.
