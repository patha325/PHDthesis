\section{General structure}
Add diagram of code, structure etc. Perhaps some code and or file structures in the appendix.
Plot the overlaying idea and structure.



\section{Reconstruction}
General purpose of reconstruction.

\subsection{Similar algorithms, code flow.}

\subsection{Pattern reconstruction}
What does it do? What are the different algorithms? What is the importance.

\subsection{Fitting}

\subsection{Performance}
Charge id, fitting id, momentum pulls and so on.
