\chapter{Neutrino interaction studies}
\label{c:neutrino}

Lab report again, trying to estimate cross-section of interactions. Why? Need it to improve oscillation measurements. Using simulations of muon neutrinos from simulation. What is done, what cuts? How Do we calculate cross-sections? Angular acceptance, look at what Marc has done, do similar things and further the calculations.


\section{Muon charge current quasi-elastic}

Acceptance study, detector layout. Beam settings? Add charge reconstruction, momentum reconstruction. Particle ID? also need interaction ID from TMVA.

Different size gap, different detector layout both early/testbeam and new at Japan.


Cross-section studies. Look at what Marc has done! 

Discuss with paul what and how to do cross-section measurements.
