\chapter{Neutrino interaction studies}
\label{c:neutrino}

Lab report again, trying to estimate cross-section of interactions. Why? Need it to improve oscillation measurements. Using simulations of muon neutrinos from simulation. What is done, what cuts? How Do we calculate cross-sections? Angular acceptance, look at what Marc has done, do similar things and further the calculations.

Discuss what to expect, what kind of interactions could happen in the TASD/WAGASCI? What could be seen? What information? Baby MIND can also have interactions, which ones would be visible? Can reconstruct muons in Baby MIND, electrons and pions visible and potentially reconstructable, but not now.

\section{Muon charge current quasi-elastic}

Direct simulations with CCQE and different geometries. Use data from specifically Baby MIND in B2 beam line. Explain the beam line etc etc.

CCQE from muon neutrino produces a muon. Clear production and easy to identify in TASD, not possible in MIND due to the design. 



Acceptance study, detector layout. Beam settings? Add charge reconstruction, momentum reconstruction. Particle ID? also need interaction ID from TMVA.

Different size gap, different detector layout both early/testbeam and new at Japan.


Cross-section studies. Look at what Marc has done! 

Discuss with paul what and how to do cross-section measurements.
