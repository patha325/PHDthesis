\section{WAGASCI}

A new water-scintillator detector, WAGASCI (WAter- Grid-SCIintilator-Detector) seen in figure~\ref{fig:WAGASCI}, is proposed to reduce the systematic error in the T2K neutrino experiment.
The main goals of the proposed detector are to improve the charge current cross section ratio between water and scintillator targets and to perform high-precision measurement of different charged current neutrino interaction channels.
