I wish to dedicate this thesis to my mathematics teacher Ulf Rydmark without whom I would not have studied physics.

Thank you Professor Paul Soler, my supervisor, for giving me this great opportunity and your help in completing this thesis. Your support these last few days has been invaluable.

A big thank you to my wife and my family who always support me through all of my endeavours and made Scotland an even better place.

Thank you to all of my friends around the world who managed to support me when moving abroad and helped keep me sane throughout all of these years. 

To all of my colleagues in Baby MIND, CERN neutrino platform and WAGASCI, thank you. This was an amazing project and we couldn't have done it without each other. A special thank you to Etam, Kenji, Saba and Aleksandr (Sascha) who really made everything fall into place. Without you I would not have managed.

To my other colleagues, Dana, Gesine, Hanna, John, Lars and Sarah. I'm not sure I would have managed past day one without your help, fika, our discussions and trips to the pub.

Thank you IT-guys, David Crooks, Gareth Roy, Sam Skipsey, Gordon Stewart, for handing the great ScotGRID bakeoff, providing advice and discussing crazy implementation of software.

Finally I would like to thank my funding agency, the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, for funding my research and part of the Baby MIND project through WP08 under AIDA2020.
